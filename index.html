    <!-- Mario Party Section -->
    <h2 id="red">1. The Mario Party Series</h2>

    <p>
      Every single Mario Party game I love, whether it's mario party 1, or 9, I
      like all of them. Mario party is a game where you have to get coins to buy
      stars, whoever has the most stars at the end wins. The First mario Party
      game I ever play was mario party 9, I loved that game, it was fun to play,
      and was a great game. the main reason to why I love the mario party games
      is cause I get to play it with other and the strats in the game, the
      minigames and trying to get stars while competing with your family and
      friends is super fun.

    <!-- Pikmin Section -->
    <h2 id="green">2. The Pikmin Series</h2>
    <p>
      Pikmin is a game where you are a crew going to another planet to get food
      for your home planet cause your home planet is dying but your ship crash
      during landing and now you are stuck on the planet but these little things
      call pikmin help you out. The reason I like this series is because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the Pikmin are cute</li>
      <li>the game has lots to explore and find hidden stuff</li>
      <li>this game has enemy and cool boss to fight to get food</li>
      <li>the strats in the game make it so you have to plan carefully</li>
      <li>
        other than story mode it has battle mode(battle someone) and mission
        mode(collect everything before time ends)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Yoshi Section -->
    <h2 id="sky">3. Yoshi Woolly world</h2>
    <p>
      Yoshi Woolly world is a game where you play as a yoshi and your friend get
      turn in yarn, so you must go out and save your friends and stop the bad
      guys. Yoshi woolly can also be played by 2 people. Yoshi is one of my
      favourite character and this game is all about yoshi. traveling through
      the levels and finding secret and fighting bosses is what makes a mario
      games fun. yoshi woolly has challenging levels and lots to do like a boss
      rush and finding every flower.

    <!-- Sm64 Section -->
    <h2 id="Crimson">4. Super Mario 64</h2>
    <p>
      Super Mario 64 is a game where you got to collect stars to save the
      princess from the evil bowser, This game is very old, this game was made
      in 1996 which make this game 28 years old, I love retro games so like
      super mario bro 3, tetris, or even paper mario, any retro I love. Even
      though I am only a teen playing this game give so much nostalgia, this
      game is fun and finding and trying to get all 120 stars while the level
      get harder is super fun, Sm64 has 15 levels each with 7 stars + there are
      15 stars hidden somewhere in the castle. you got to go through the level
      and do a certain task to get the stars, the task could be defeat this guy,
      or get 100 coins. The story and the music in the game is super good to.
      This game is also very popular and is one of the biggest game ever, it's
      also has one of the biggest speedrun community (I have done a speedrun).
      This game just has so much which is why it makes the list.
